<h2>About</h2>

<p>This is a website created for an assignment in the course ”Client based web programming” (1DV022) at the Linnaeus University. My name is Kajsa Lindelöw, I’m 32 year old and currently living in Stockholm, with my partner and our 2 year old son. <br> </p>

<p>I have a background in the health sector, working as a physiotherapist. I’ve enjoyed my work so far, but during the last years I’ve also felt a need to try something totally different. I’ve always been fascinated by web development and web graphics, and since I have two brothers working as web developers and a partner working as a graphic designer, it came quite natural to me to choose this field of study.</p>
